Make sure that all items are entered correctly. Any errors will cause the 
program to crash.

Folders should be a single word. Words can be combined with the underscore 
character ("_"). Also, use forward slashes ("\") at the end of folder names.
Python can get confused with back slashes. It uses it as an escape character. 

Do not use special characters in Excel file names.

The length of time that you are allowed to respond to reCAPTCHA messages is 
set by the "RECAPTCHA_TIMEOUT" variable.

When entering the Excel file name, leave the '.xlsx' out. The program adds it
automatically.

It is very important that you select a cutoff that is between 3 and 50. If you
select one outside of this range, the program will crash.

For automatic recombination points determination, set AUTO_REC_PNTS to "True".

Run ARP_Scale_Factor.py to determine SCALE_FACTOR. 

Set CROMOSOME_LENGTH_SCALE_FACTOR to 1.

End phased kits names with "PP" for paternal phased kits and "MP" for maternal
phased kits.

If using phased kits, make sure that a phased kit is last in the list.

Set CHROMOSOME_X to "True" to add chromosome 23 to the list of selected 
chromosomes. Enter "0" in CHROMOSOMES_SELECTED to deselect all autosomal
chromosomes. By setting CHROMOSOME_X to "True" and entering "0" in CHROMOSOMES_
SELECTED, only chromosome 23 will be compared.
